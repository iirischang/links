## Project 4: Links
Hi, I'm Iris. This is the fourth project for the Typography & Interaction class (2024-2025). <br>
The project focuses on collection and organization using Are.na as a platform, exploring how designers connect varied content through digital interfaces.<br>
This project challenged me to explore the relationship between typography and interaction by creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure, style, and add dynamic elements to the webpage.

*Thank you for checking out my project!*
